          Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Wassim, I study Computer Science at Wayne State University. I write software in C++, and am quite good at it.
          Furtheremore, I'm a Full-Stack web developer. I create dynamic websites and web applications. I use a mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL.
          However, my qualities go beyond technical skillset.

        <p class = "text-left lead font-weight-normal">
          Besides work, I have lots of hobbies and interests. I love Aviation, catch up on the latest in the industry, and use a flight simulator.
          I love Architecture and Civil Engineering, and watch many documentaries depicting the construction of symbolic skyscrapers.
          Beyond that, I like physical activity.

          I'm a problem solver. I solve coding problems with a calm, cool attitude. I work on big projects, one problem at a time.
          I admit ignorance and take a step back to evaluate my problem-solving methodology, in coding and in life.

          I have an abundance of reasons to get myself up in the morning, without a cup of coffee. I motivate myself by envisioning my
          ideal lifestlye, personality, and work ethic.

          I'm working towards very serious goals in my life. I'm constantly looking for new projects to work on and new ideas to explore.
          If I have an idea, I pursue it aggressively.
